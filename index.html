            My name is Simona. I am a student at NBU in Sofia and my major is Informatics. I have completed the SoftUni
            Creative path for Graphic Designer and UI/UX Designer. Through the years I have worked with many teams on
            different projects in the fields of Robotics, Informational technologies and Multimedia projects. Currently
            I am studying on my own to become a Front-End Developer. I am also a mentor of a kid's robotic team at my
            home town Razgrad. My goal is to learn as much as I can and to be helpful to as many people as possible.
